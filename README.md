# Diet-Planner-Using-Deep-Learning

Firstly we take a dataset and preprocessed it according to our project requirements.
Then we used K-means clustering to group similar foods based on their nutritional composition. Clustering algorithms, such as K-means, can help identify patterns in the dataset and group foods that have similar nutritional profiles. By clustering the foods, we can create a diverse set of options that meet our nutritional requirements while also providing variety in taste and texture. It is important to note that the number of clusters should be chosen carefully to ensure that there are enough options to create a balanced diet plan.
Once we have the clusters, we can use a deep learning model, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to generate a sequence of foods that meet our nutritional requirements. The LSTM model takes as input the last seven foods selected from the clusters and predicts the nutritional values of the next food to be added to the diet plan. These predicted values are then used to filter the available foods in the dataset, ensuring that the selected food matches the nutritional requirements. From the filtered list, a food is randomly selected and added to the diet plan sequence. This process continues until the total daily calorie intake is met.
